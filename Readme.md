## Blog Data Service

###What's this
I always wanted my blog to be editable on github, anybody should be able to submit a PR to any of my articles to improve them or fix typos (I make lots of typos!) but I never liked any of the architectural model out there to manage content from github, therefore I wanted to build my own, won't be as good as other solutions out there but it'll be good enough for me and will fit my needs!
